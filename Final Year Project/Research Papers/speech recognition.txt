speech recognition is the machine on the statement or command of human speech to identify and understand
and react accordingly. it allows the bot to automatically identify and understand human spoken language through signal processing and pattern recognition
the voice through the microphone is converted into an electrical signal. 
Representative speech recognition methods include
dynamic time warping (DTW), hidden Markov model
(HMM), vector quantization (VQ), artificial neural network
(ANN), support vector machine (SVM) and so on.The article
focuses on two methods of hidden Markov model (HMM)
and artificial neural network (ANN).
The HMM model parameters represent the time-varying
characteristics of the voice signal.it uses statistical methods of training the
underlying acoustic model and the upper voice model into
the unified voice recognition search algorithm can obtain
better recognition results, and can be used for continuous
speech recognition, but the drawback is the need to be very
sophisticated calculations and a longer training sequence. 
A. Application of speech recognition technology
there are many speech recognition applications like system-VRCP system
developed by AT&T in 1992. In September 1996, Charles Schwab launched the first
large-scale commercial speech recognition application
systems: the stock quotation system.
another development branch of speech recognition technology is the development of the telephone voice recognition technology. this will be able to telephone inquires, automatic writing
as well as some specialized operations. it can provide 24/7 phone banking service
B. The facing problems 
there are many problems faced by the speech recognition and it is mainly reflected on the dependence of the environment
if the environment is noisy then it is very difficult to progress the speech
like voice, slow speech rate etc.
